# closedAI

## Motto
- Just try first, get our feets wet, explore possible ways

## Things to Do:
- Use the exploration folder to just dump any notebooks / datasets we come across
- Followed by self documentation on what's the approach, what worked, what didn't, what could be improved on
- Possible potential project ideas (not necessary - more of getting our feets wet)

## Current Plan 
- We decided to go for an aspect based sentiment analysis on as a tool for recommending/improving products. The input would be whatever reviews/comments was mentioned about the product/service and the output would be the various aspects that are positive and negative, allowing businesses to see where they can improve their products/services or maintain their strengths in.

- We are looking at restaurants, hotels, cosmetic products - so if we scale up, it could be a useful tool that also can be used to benefit consumers - allow consumers to get recommendations based on their priorities - maybe good mexican food, ambience etc

- Currently, we are self studying on aspect based learning so we get a better idea on how to execute and we will come together to decide on the dataset by the end of the month after looking at the different ways we can do it.


## Deadline
- 28th Dec (Self Research on Aspect Based Learning - kaggle notebooks / model exploration) ; find how they do it
- 31st Dec (Decide on Topic / Data Set)
